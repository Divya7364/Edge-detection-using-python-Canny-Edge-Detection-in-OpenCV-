# EDGE DETECTION: Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images.

Based on image brightness and gray factors it detects the edges in the input image
Edge detection is used for image segmentation and data Extraction in areas such as image processing, computer vision and machine vision.
# Real World Applications
Fingerprint Scanners in mobile phones.
Satellite Image processing.
Medical science fields.
# Computer Vision
A Canny edge detector is a multi-step algorithm to detect the edges for any input image.
